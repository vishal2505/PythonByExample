#Given two sentences, return an array that has the words that appear in one sentence and not
#the other and an array with the words in common. 

sentence1 = 'We are really pleased to meet you in our city'
sentence2 = 'The city was hit by a really heavy storm'

def solution(sentence1, sentence2):
    set1 = set(sentence1.split())
